Watchdog for monitoring automations in Home Assistant

This automation acts as a "watchdog" that ensures that your most critical automations are always active and working properly, and alerts you if any become inactive. This ensures that you do not miss important alarms or functions in your system, and gives you peace of mind that the automation continues to run smoothly.
